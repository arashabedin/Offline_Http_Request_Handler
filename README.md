# Offline_Http_Request_Handler
In this project I aim to build a module that handles HTTP requests when the user is offline. This module should
enable options such as pending requests offline and invoking them again as soon as a connection triggred with the 
server. It should also enable the client to cancel the requests while being offline in order to remove them them from
pending list.
